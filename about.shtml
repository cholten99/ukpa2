          <h1 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">About the UK Polyamory Association</h1>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">History</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
          The UKPA was originally founded in 2022 by Giulia Smith, Jenny Wilson, Emily Payne, Grace Withers, Eunice Hung, Jennie Philips and Maxine Green. After actively supporting the community for three years, the leadership group was experiencing burn-out and it was decided to pause operations until new organisers could be found. In late 2024 David Durant joined the organising committee in a coordinating role and in late 2025 we rebooted the Association with renewed energy!
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Our Goals</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            The goals of the UKPA are to advance the cause of polyamory in the UK following the
            model of other campaigning organisations such as Stonewall. We intend to do this
            through many methods including the following.
          </p>

          <ul class="mt-4 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Providing statistics about the uptake of polyamory in the UK</li>
            <li>Producing education materials about polyamory</li>
            <li>Bringing together and supporting the diverse in-person and online polyamory communities in the UK</li>
            <li>Tracking the portrayal of polyamory in the media</li>
            <li>Working with companies to create polyamory friendly HR policies</li>
            <li>Research what changes are needed in UK law to support polyamorous families</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Our current priorities</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Our initial priorities are the following.
          </p>

          <ul class="mt-4 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Responding to the Office of National Statistic consultation on the next Census with a view to including one or more questions related to polyamory</li>
            <li>Reaching out to organisations like Stonewall to learn what we can from people who have done this before</li>
            <li>Research provision of educational resources</li>
            <li>Research cost and design of national surveys</li>
            <li>Collect examples of existing polyamory friendly corporate HR policies</li>
            <li>Work with the Green Party to help them develop their policy position on polyamorous families</li>
